# Project Background
Gujarat-based FMCG company AtliQ Mart lost key customers due to delivery problems and now needs to track three critical metrics daily: On-Time Delivery (OT%) measuring orders delivered on the promised date, In-Full Delivery (IF%) measuring orders with complete quantities, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF%) measuring orders that meet both criteria, all compared against customer-specific targets before expanding to new cities.

Insights & Recommendations

- **Service Level Performance Analysis**
  We focus on OTIF%, OnTime%, and InFull% to gauge overall delivery performance, track achievement against targets, and identify critical service gaps affecting customer satisfaction and retention.
- **City-wise Performance Comparison**
  Analyzing delivery metrics across Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara helps identify location-specific challenges, optimize distribution networks, and establish regional benchmarks before expansion to new cities.
- **Customer Service Level Variations**
  Evaluating service metrics by customer highlights accounts at risk, reveals customer-specific patterns, and prioritizes improvement efforts for high-value or strategic relationships.
- **Product Performance Patterns**
  Tracking Line Fill Rate and Volume Fill Rate across product categories identifies specific inventory management challenges, informs procurement strategies, and ensures focus on high-impact product lines.
