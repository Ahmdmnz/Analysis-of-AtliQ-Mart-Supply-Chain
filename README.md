# Project Background
Gujarat-based FMCG company AtliQ Mart lost key customers due to delivery problems and now needs to track three critical metrics daily: On-Time Delivery (OT%) measuring orders delivered on the promised date, In-Full Delivery (IF%) measuring orders with complete quantities, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF%) measuring orders that meet both criteria, all compared against customer-specific targets before expanding to new cities.

Insights & Recommendations

- **Service Level Performance Analysis**
  We focus on OTIF%, OnTime%, and InFull% to gauge overall delivery performance, track achievement against targets, and identify critical service gaps affecting customer satisfaction and retention.
  
- **City-wise Performance Comparison**
  Analyzing delivery metrics across Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara helps identify location-specific challenges, optimize distribution networks, and establish regional benchmarks before expansion to new cities.
  
- **Customer Service Level Variations**
  Evaluating service metrics by customer highlights accounts at risk, reveals customer-specific patterns, and prioritizes improvement efforts for high-value or strategic relationships.
  
- **Product Performance Patterns**
  Tracking Line Fill Rate and Volume Fill Rate across product categories identifies specific inventory management challenges, informs procurement strategies, and ensures focus on high-impact product lines.

# Excutive Summary
## Overview of Findings
AtliQ Mart's delivery performance metrics show significant challenges across all service levels, with OTIF at only 29% against a 65% target. On-Time delivery (59%) and In-Full delivery (53%) are both substantially below their respective goals of 85% and 76%. While Volume Fill Rate remains strong at 97%, indicating product availability, the Line Fill Rate of 66% reveals critical issues in order fulfillment. These service gaps are consistent across all three operational cities and most pronounced with key customers like Acclaimed Stores and Coolblue, explaining the recent contract losses. Addressing these service level failures is essential before proceeding with planned expansion to additional metro markets.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report.
